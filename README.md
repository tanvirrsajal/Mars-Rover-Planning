# Mars-Rover-Planning

This project defines a comprehensive planning domain for controlling a robot on Mars, developed using the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). The domain involves essential actions and predicates that describe the robot's capabilities and its interactions with the Martian environment. These actions include navigating between locations, stabilizing locations for operations, deploying and activating sensors, collecting samples even twice when needed, processing and storing data, go back to the base, wait for a communication channel, transmits data and finally closing the channel.
The planning domain is structured with specific types, such as robots, locations, and sensors, to ensure clear and efficient task execution. Actions are meticulously defined to enable the robot to perform sequences of tasks autonomously. For example, the robot can navigate to a location, stabilize it, deploy and activate a sensor, collect samples, process the data, store it, and then transmit it back to the base station when a communication channel is available.
This domain serves as a foundational model for developing automated plans for Mars missions, enabling robots to carry out intricate tasks with minimal human intervention. It aims to enhance the efficiency and reliability of robotic operations on Mars, paving the way for more advanced and autonomous exploratory missions.


BFWS--FF-parser version(https://editor.planning.domains/#) solver was used to find the path plan. You can upload the problem and domain file and use the solver option to find a plan.
